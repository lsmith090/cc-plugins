"""
Hooks Framework Unit Tests

Focused unit tests for the Hooks Framework that catch real bugs
and provide value. After a ruthless audit, only valuable tests remain.

Current Tests:
- test_pretool_json_validation_bug.py: Caught real bug in JSON validation

This streamlined test suite prioritizes catching actual bugs over test theater.
Tests are retained only if they provide genuine value by catching real issues
or testing critical functionality.
