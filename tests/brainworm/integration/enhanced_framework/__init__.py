"""
Hooks Framework Integration Tests

Focused integration tests for the Hooks Framework that provide
genuine value. After cleanup, only valuable tests remain.

Current Tests:
- test_framework_hook_integration.py: End-to-end hook execution tests
- test_type_system_compliance.py: Claude Code specification compliance tests

These tests focus on real integration scenarios that matter, eliminating
test theater in favor of tests that actually catch bugs and validate
critical functionality.
