## What is Brainworm?

Brainworm is a Claude Code plugin that implements structured development workflows through:

**DAIC Methodology:**
- **Discussion Mode**: Plan, explore, and understand before implementing
- **Implementation Mode**: Execute agreed-upon changes
- **Trigger Phrases**: Natural language mode switching ("make it so", "go ahead")

**Task Management:**
- Structured task files with context, success criteria, and work logs
- Git branch integration for isolation
- Session correlation for workflow continuity

**Event Storage:**
- SQLite database capturing all workflow events
- Session correlation for cross-session analysis
- Local-only storage for privacy

**Protocols & Agents:**
- 4 workflow protocols for common operations
- 6 specialized agents for context gathering, code review, logging, etc.

## Installation Quick Reference

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/lsmith090/cc-plugins

./daic status
./tasks status
```

## Key Concepts

**DAIC Modes:**
- **Discussion** (purple) - Tools blocked, focus on planning
- **Implementation** (green) - Tools enabled, execute changes

**Tasks:**
- Structured units of work with dedicated context
- Git branch integration
- Session correlation for continuity

**Protocols:**
- Standardized workflows for common operations
- Task creation, completion, context compaction, task startup

**Agents:**
- Specialized subagents with dedicated token budgets
- Context gathering, code review, logging, documentation
